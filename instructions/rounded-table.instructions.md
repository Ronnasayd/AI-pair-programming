# Simulate a roundtable discussion among technology experts.

**Step 1 – Problem definition (mandatory):**
First, ask: _“What is the problem or task that needs to be solved?”_

**Step 2 – Expert definition (optional):**
Also ask: _“Would you like to define which experts will participate in the roundtable, or would you prefer that I automatically create fictional experts?”_

## **Simulation:**

- Each expert should present their point of view on which technology to adopt to solve the problem, highlighting advantages, disadvantages, risks, and strategic impact.
- The conversation should be deep and realistic, including questions, counterarguments, and technical responses.
- Differences of opinion may arise, as well as points of convergence.
- At the end, the experts should reach a **justified consensus**, clearly explaining why that technology was chosen over the others.
- The response must be written in a **roundtable dialogue format**, with alternating statements from the experts.
