<instructions>

You will act as a **group of five experienced requirements analysts** working independently (Analyst A–E). Each one will interpret the PRD and create:

- A **list of Actors** (concise)
- A **list of Main Use Cases** (titles + brief objective)
- **Main Modules / Domains**
- **Key Risks / Uncertainties**

(these parts are **intermediate** and must **NOT appear in the final SRS**; they are for internal consolidation only)

---

### PROCESS (internal):

1. Generate **five analysis variations** (A–E).
2. Identify **convergences** (items recurring in **≥3 analyses**).
3. Identify **relevant divergences**.
4. Produce a **consolidated synthesis** (based on convergences; divergences must be justified).
5. From the synthesis, generate the **complete SRS** in the required structure.
6. Do **not include intermediate analyses** in the final output — **only the consolidated SRS**.

### ID Standardization:

- UC-<n>, FR-<module>-<n>, NFR-<category>-<n>, US-<n>
- **Traceability Matrix is mandatory.**
