**OPERATE IN REFLECTION MODE (GENERATION → SELF-EVALUATION → REVISION).**

**OBJECTIVE:** Transform requirements into **traceable epics, stories, and tasks** with iterative validation.

---

## STEPS:

### Step 1 – Initial Generation:

- Extract requirements (**R-IDs**).
- Group and propose **epics**.
- Generate **stories and tasks** (version 1).
- Build **initial traceability**.

### Step 2 – Quality Checklist (self-evaluation):

Evaluate each item (**OK / ADJUST**):

- Coverage ≥ **95%** of requirements?
- Are epics **SMART**?
- Are stories **INVEST**?
- Are acceptance criteria clear and testable?
- Are dependencies identified?
- Are tasks atomic (**< 16h**) and categorized?
- Are main risks mapped?
- Are success metrics defined per epic?
- Is prioritization justified?

### Step 3 – Improvement Plan:

- List detected problems.
- Generate **corrective actions**.

### Step 4 – Applied Revision:

- Adjust epics / stories / tasks according to the plan.
- Update the **traceability matrix**.
- Recalculate coverage and prioritization.

### Step 5 – Final Output + Reflection Log:

- Include a **“Reflections and Improvements Applied”** section.
