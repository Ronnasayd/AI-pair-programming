## Guide: Technical Spec Review (gaps, inconsistencies, implicit requirements)

Audit spec docs (spec.md, design.md, tasks.md, requirements.md, context-map.md, cited ADRs) against actual code, then apply corrections. Spec = hypothesis, never truth. Ask user once before editing (Step 4).

| #   | Step                | Action                                                                                                                                                                              | Output / Gate                                                    |
| --- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Gather              | List feature spec dir; count lines (whole vs parts); read every file fully + cited ADRs                                                                                             | Full picture of problem, goals, ACs, design, tasks, requirements |
| 2   | Verify vs code      | Confirm each decision/assumption/contract in source — checklist: [verification-checklist.md](references/verification-checklist.md)                                                  | Claim → confirmed / false / unverifiable                         |
| 3   | Classify            | Group findings by severity (table below)                                                                                                                                            | Report to user                                                   |
| 4   | Confirm scope       | **One** question round: (a) severity groups to fix now (offer "report only"); (b) design decisions with >1 reasonable solution → options + technical implication each               | User answers before any edit                                     |
| 5   | Apply fixes         | Tracker task per file/group (in-progress → complete). Per-file edits: [fix-by-file.md](references/fix-by-file.md)                                                                   | Docs consistent with each other + code                           |
| 6   | Sync derived system | Only if spec feeds separate tracker (taskmaster): [taskmaster-sync.md](references/taskmaster-sync.md)                                                                               | Only derived fields changed                                      |
| 7   | Residue check       | Grep every replaced term/snippet (nonexistent command, removed FK, old route, truncation marker) across touched files; each remaining hit must be intentional (explains the change) | Zero forgotten leftovers                                         |
| 8   | Report              | See report table below                                                                                                                                                              | Direct summary to user                                           |

## Severity (Step 3)

| Level                           | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| High                            | Breaks error contract; command/flag missing in installed version; corrupted/truncated data in doc; validation blocking real system case (e.g. ID in non-guaranteed format); missing integrity constraint domain logic assumes; success criterion with no real test |
| Medium                          | External dep (FK) can fail on valid system path; justification doesn't match cited code; task underestimates blast radius of contract change; accepted consequence unrecorded; unspecified data normalization                                                      |
| Inconsistencies / implicit reqs | Docs stale vs each other (one superseded another); declared deps diverge from real tracker; incomplete "files to modify"; broken req ID ↔ task ID traceability; out-of-scope item unrelated to card; type/value specified but unused in any rule                   |

## Report (Step 8)

| #   | Include                                                                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Fixes by severity — don't repeat full earlier report                                        |
| 2   | Decisions that change implementation — highlight separately (matter most to task executors) |
| 3   | State explicitly: no build/test run when change was docs only                               |
| 4   | Items deliberately kept despite being raised as possible problem + reason                   |
